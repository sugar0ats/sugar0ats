Here are some projects I've made. They might not be super technically impressive or pretty, but they all have a special place in my heart ðŸ’“


**Work in progress:** Astro Cat

A website dedicated to fun games and visual explanations to help beginners truly get their footing. 

[Solubilty Checker ](https://sugar0ats.github.io/solubility-rules/)

Want to know if an ionic compound is soluble or not? This is the page to check!

[Paper Plane](https://sugar0ats.github.io/paperairplane/)

A journaling app for a hackathon. Made in p5.js because it was the only thing I knew at the time. It was cute, though :)
